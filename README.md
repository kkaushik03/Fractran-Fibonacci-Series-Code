## Fractran by John Conway
 Fractran is a programming language developed by the renowned mathematician John Conway. It is a unique language that operates on fractions instead of conventional numerical values. In Fractran, programs are defined as a series of fractions, with each fraction representing a computational step.

## How Fractran Works
When executing a Fractran program, an input fraction is provided, and the program performs a sequence of multiplications and divisions using the fractions defined in the program. The process continues until the program terminates or meets a predefined condition.

At each step, the numerator of the input fraction is multiplied or divided by a fraction from the program. The resulting fraction becomes the input for the next step, and the process iterates until it reaches an end state.

Turing Completeness
### Fractran is considered a Turing-complete language, meaning it can simulate any Turing machine and perform arbitrary computations. Despite its complexity and limited practicality for general-purpose programming, Fractran offers valuable insights into the theoretical foundations of computation and the properties of rational numbers.
